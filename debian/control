Description: FooBillard++ is an 3D OpenGL billiards game
 FooBillard++ is a free OpenGL-billard game for Linux and based on the
 original foobillard 3.0a source from Florian Berger. Started at 12/2010
 an advanced version is in progress with foobillard++. It's not really a
 new game, but an advanced with a lot of fixes, new options, graphics and
 features until the last version of foobillard (2007).
 At this point it's started with a special version for the Touch-PC WeTab.
